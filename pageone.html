                        <p>Welcome to Stay for Strays, a passionate advocacy dedicated to improving the lives of stray dogs. Our mission is to provide shelter, medical care, and loving homes to dogs that have been abandoned, neglected, or born on the streets. We believe every dog deserves a second chance at a happy and healthy life.</p><br>

We also focus on community outreach, education, and spay/neuter programs to address the root causes of stray dog populations.</p><br>
                        <p>We envision a world where no dog is left to suffer on the streets. Join us in our mission to make a difference, one paw at a time. Whether through adoption, volunteering, or donations, your support helps us save lives and give these wonderful animals the love and care they deserve.</p>
